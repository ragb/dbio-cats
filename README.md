# DBIO-Cats


[Cats](https://github.com/typelevel/cats) instances to use with [Slick](http://slick.lightbend.com)

Main goal is to be able to effectively use [DBIOAction](http://slick.lightbend.com/doc/3.1.1/api/#package) with monad transformers such as [OptionT](http://typelevel.org/cats/tut/optiont.html).
